# Optical-Interconnection-Network

The aim of this project is to analyze the channel utilization of an Optical Interconnection Network. Based on the research conducted by M.F. Akay, Ç.İ. Aci, F. Abut (see References), multiple metrics were used to determine the performance of a 2-dimensional Simultaneous Optical Multiprocessor Exchange Bus (2D SOME-Bus) implementation of a multiprocessor architecture. 

## Datasets:

The .csv file used in this project contains 640 performance measurements. Additional information about each feature can be found in the optical_data_features.txt file. Both files are located in the data folder.

## Model:

This project utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN).
